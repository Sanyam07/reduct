Reduct
======

An app for visualising high-dimensional data via interactive embedding.
Uses Plotly Dash.

In experimental development.

To install, create an environment and `pip install -r requirements.txt`

For latest versions of packages, follow Dash installation instructions at https://plot.ly/dash/getting-started. These default versions of Dash currently won't work with reduct as we are using features from a release candidate.

See usage with

```python app.py -h```
